# Sharpening2020
A grumpy amateur attempts a Magic: The Gathering rules enforcement engine.

Hopeful features:
*Full undo, save and replay, facilitated by a Command pattern actuating all changes on the model. Commands are serializable.
*Player type agnostic, allowing eventual networked play / AI play.
*AI assistance, either for outright cheating(knowing all cards), randomizing unknown cards, archetype/deck recognition etc.
